Inside, you’ve got the essentials for an easy “island-living but still comfortable” trip, including A/C and internet access, plus a private kitchen so breakfast doesn’t require shoes. It’s a great base for beach days, boat days, and bike rides around the area (the beach is sometimes nicknamed “Turtle Beach”, but consider turtles a bonus sighting, not a guarantee).",

It’s the kind of place you book when you want quiet mornings, salty air, and the feeling that the island is running on its own gentle clock. Guests have direct beach access, an on-site pool, and a waterfront restaurant and bar for easy island meals without hopping back and forth. Boaters love it too, thanks to the marina/dock setup, and it’s a great base for exploring Elizabeth Harbour, Chat ‘N’ Chill, sandbars, and all the classic Exuma boat-day magic. If you’re looking for a relaxed, ‘toes-in-the-sand’ stay that still keeps you close to town, this one checks a lot of boxes.",
